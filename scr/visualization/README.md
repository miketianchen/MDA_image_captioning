### Visualization Scripts Folder

Scripts to create exploratory and results oriented visualizations.

To run the visualization tool, one needs to first install `django` which is used as the backend of the tool.
Then navigate into the correct folder and call the `runserver` command to start the local server.

> pip install django

> cd ./591_capstone_2020-mda-mds/scr/visualization/mda_mds

> python manage.py runserver
